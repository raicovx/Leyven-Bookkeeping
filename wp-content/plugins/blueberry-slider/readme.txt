A simple image slider based on Mark Tyrrel's jQuery BlueBerry Slider Plugin.

== Description ==

A nice little image slider that I put together in my free time.  

It's based off the Blueberry jQuery Plugin by Mark Tyrrel and uses Plupload to upload images instead of the wordpress image uploader.

Things to note:

*   You can drag and drop images into the order you want them to appear.
*   You can insert a gallery into any page using the [blueberry] shortcode
*   Shortcodes are automatically generated when you create a new "slider"

== Installation ==

1. Upload `blueberry-slider.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place [blueberry id="YOURID"] in any page or post
